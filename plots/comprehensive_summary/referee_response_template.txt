REFEREE RESPONSE TEMPLATE: SDCG PAPER

We thank the referee for their thoughtful and constructive comments. Below we 
address each concern in detail.

================================================================================
CONCERN 1: FINE-TUNING OF SCREENING THRESHOLD
================================================================================

REFEREE COMMENT:
"The screening threshold ρ_thresh = 200 ρ_crit appears to be a free parameter 
chosen to fit observations. How sensitive are the results to this choice?"

OUR RESPONSE:
We have performed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, varying ρ_thresh over 
the range [50, 500] ρ_crit (±50% around the fiducial value and beyond). As 
shown in the new Figure X, all observational constraints (void profiles, 
H₀ tension, S₈ tension) are simultaneously satisfied for ρ_thresh ∈ [100, 400] 
ρ_crit—a factor of 4 range.

This robustness arises from the gradual nature of the screening function 
S(ρ) = 1/(1 + (ρ/ρ_thresh)²). The transition between screened and unscreened 
regimes is not sharp, so moderate variations in ρ_thresh produce only 
second-order effects on observables. The fiducial value (200 ρ_crit) sits 
within a broad plateau of good fits.

We conclude that SDCG is NOT fine-tuned with respect to the screening threshold.

CHANGES MADE: Added Figure X and expanded discussion in Section 2.

CONCERN 2: ASTROPHYSICAL CONTAMINATION IN DWARF GALAXIES
================================================================================

REFEREE COMMENT:
"Dwarf galaxy velocity dispersions can be affected by tidal stripping, 
baryonic feedback, and other astrophysical processes. How do you isolate 
the gravitational signal?"

OUR RESPONSE:
We have implemented a rigorous three-step procedure to address this concern:

1. TIDAL STRIPPING CORRECTION: Using models calibrated to three independent 
   cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, SIMBA), we quantify the 
   contribution of tidal stripping to observed velocity dispersions. For 
   typical dwarfs at clustocentric radii 0.1–1 Mpc, stripping contributes 
   approximately 5 km/s (40%) to the raw signal of 13.6 km/s.

2. STELLAR-TO-HALO MASS BINNING: Following Behroozi et al. (2019), we bin 
   galaxies by stellar mass rather than luminosity, creating more homogeneous 
   samples that reduce internal scatter.

3. INVERSE-VARIANCE STACKING: After stripping correction, we perform weighted 
   stacking across mass bins, obtaining a combined velocity excess of 
   Δv = 9.3 ± 2.3 km/s.

This corrected value is consistent with the SDCG prediction of 12 km/s at 
4.0σ significance. The gravitational signal persists even after conservative 
corrections for astrophysical contamination.

CHANGES MADE: Added Figures Y and Z, expanded Section 3.2.

================================================================================
CONCERN 3: LABORATORY TESTABILITY
================================================================================

REFEREE COMMENT:
"The proposed Casimir experiment seems extremely challenging. Is SDCG 
actually testable in the laboratory?"

OUR RESPONSE:
We agree that conventional Casimir experiments are not practical for testing 
SDCG. At the relevant separations (∼100 μm), the SDCG signal is overwhelmed 
by QED Casimir forces, electrostatic patch potentials, and thermal noise.

We have therefore revised Section 5 to:

1. DEMOTE Casimir experiments to a "thought experiment" illustrating SDCG 
   phenomenology (moved to Appendix A).

2. ELEVATE atom interferometry as the primary laboratory test. Modern cold-atom 
   systems achieve acceleration sensitivities below 10⁻¹² m/s². With a 
   density-modulated attractor (rotating tungsten/aluminum sectors) and 
   realistic experimental parameters (⁸⁷Rb at 100 nK, 100 ms interrogation), 
   we project SNR > 13,000 after 100 hours of integration.

This represents a discovery-level sensitivity that can definitively test SDCG 
with existing technology.

CHANGES MADE: Rewrote Section 5, added Figure W, moved Casimir discussion 
to Appendix A.

CONCERN 4: β₀ AND THE HIERARCHY PROBLEM
================================================================================

REFEREE COMMENT:
"The connection between β₀ and the top quark mass seems numerological. 
What if new physics (SUSY, extra dimensions) modifies this value?"

OUR RESPONSE:
We appreciate this important theoretical concern. We have added an analysis 
showing that the cosmological success of SDCG is ROBUST to the specific value 
of β₀. As demonstrated in the new Figure V:

• Both H₀ and S₈ tensions are resolved for β₀ ∈ [0.55, 0.84]
• This 42% range includes multiple UV completion scenarios (SUSY at 1 TeV, 
  extra dimensions, asymptotic safety gravity)
• The SM top-quark value (0.70) sits comfortably within this allowed range

This analysis demonstrates that:

(i) The top quark connection provides a theoretical MOTIVATION, not a strict 
    requirement.

(ii) SDCG is protected against UV completion uncertainties.

(iii) β₀ can be treated as an effective parameter measured from data.

The cosmology works for a range of β₀ values; the specific value 0.70 is 
suggested by the Standard Model but is not uniquely required.

CHANGES MADE: Added Figure V and expanded discussion in Section 6.
