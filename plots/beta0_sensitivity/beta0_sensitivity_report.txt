β₀ ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS: UV COMPLETION INDEPENDENCE
================================================================================
Date: 2026-02-03

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
The cosmological success of SDCG is ROBUST to the specific value of β₀.
Both Hubble and S₈ tensions are resolved for β₀ ∈ [0.55, 0.84].

This 42% range around the SM value demonstrates that:
1. The top quark derivation is a MOTIVATION, not a REQUIREMENT
2. UV completion uncertainties do NOT undermine the cosmology
3. β₀ can be treated as an EFFECTIVE PARAMETER measured from data

ALLOWED PARAMETER RANGE

KEY STATEMENTS FOR PAPER REVISION
================================================================================

1. DECOUPLING FROM HIERARCHY PROBLEM:
   "While the connection to the top quark conformal anomaly provides an 
   elegant derivation of β₀ ≈ 0.70, the cosmological predictions of SDCG 
   do not depend critically on this specific value. As shown in Figure X, 
   the Hubble and S₈ tensions are resolved for β₀ ∈ [0.55, 0.84]."

2. ROBUSTNESS TO NEW PHYSICS:
   "Even if new physics (supersymmetry, extra dimensions, hidden sectors) 
   modifies the running of β₀ between electroweak and Hubble scales, the 
   cosmological success of SDCG remains intact. The allowed range spans 
   42% of the fiducial value."

3. PHENOMENOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT:
   "SDCG can be treated as a complete effective field theory below ~1 TeV, 
   with β₀ as a measurable parameter. Its value can be determined empirically 
   from cosmological data, independent of ultraviolet details."

4. TOP QUARK AS MOTIVATION:
   "The top quark connection should be viewed as a theoretical motivation 
   rather than a strict requirement. The core SDCG mechanism—density-dependent 
   gravitational screening—stands on its own phenomenological merits."

================================================================================
IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

1. PROTECTING COSMOLOGY:
   If referees criticize the top quark derivation as "numerology", we can 
   respond: "The cosmology works for a RANGE of β₀ values. The specific 
   value 0.70 is suggested by the SM, but not required."

2. FUTURE TESTS:
   Laboratory measurements (atom interferometry) can directly measure β₀
   without any reference to particle physics. This provides an independent
   determination that can be compared to the SM prediction.

3. THEORETICAL FLEXIBILITY:
   SDCG is compatible with various UV completions. The cosmological 
   predictions are an emergent property of the low-energy effective theory,
   not contingent on high-energy details.
