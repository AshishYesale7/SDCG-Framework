EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This document reframes the laboratory testing strategy for SDCG:

BEFORE: Casimir gravity crossover experiment as primary test
AFTER:  Atom interferometry as primary test, Casimir demoted to Appendix

REASON: Casimir experiment faces insurmountable thermal noise (signal buried
        10^7× below noise at 300K). Atom interferometry offers SNR > 10,000.

================================================================================
SECTION 5.1: PRIMARY TEST - ATOM INTERFEROMETRY (NEW)
================================================================================

5.1.1 Experimental Concept
--------------------------

We propose a definitive laboratory test of SDCG using atom interferometry
with a density-modulated rotating attractor. This approach:

• Completely avoids Casimir force contamination
• Achieves sensitivity δ(ΔG/G) ~ 10^{-12}, well above the 10^{-9} signal
• Uses mature, well-characterized technology
• Can be implemented at existing facilities worldwide

5.1.2 Apparatus Design
----------------------

ATTRACTOR:
• Geometry: 10 cm radius cylinder, 20 cm height
• Configuration: 8 alternating sectors (4 pairs)
• Materials: Tungsten (ρ = 19,300 kg/m³) and Aluminum (ρ = 2,700 kg/m³)
• Rotation: 10 Hz → signal at 40 Hz
• Distance from atoms: 15 cm

ATOM INTERFEROMETER:
• Species: Rb-87 at 100 nK
• Atom number: 10^6 per shot
• Configuration: Dual gradiometer (10 cm baseline)
• Interrogation time: 100 ms
• Pulse sequence: 4-photon Bragg transitions

5.1.3 SDCG Signal Prediction
----------------------------

The screening function S(ρ) = 1/(1 + (ρ/ρ_thresh)²) gives:

• Tungsten: S(ρ_W) ≈ 0.92 (high density → strong screening)
• Aluminum: S(ρ_Al) ≈ 0.15 (low density → weak screening)

As the attractor rotates, atoms experience oscillating effective G:

    G_eff(t) = G × [1 + μ × S(ρ(t))]

The oscillation amplitude is:

    ΔG/G = μ_bare × |S_W - S_Al| = 0.48 × 0.77 ≈ 0.37

This creates an acceleration signal:

    a_signal = 3.8 × 10^{-8} m/s² at 40 Hz

5.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis
--------------------------

Atom interferometer sensitivity (shot-noise limited):

    δa = 1/(k_eff × T² × √N) × 1/√n_cycles

For our parameters:
• Single shot: δa_shot = 3.1 × 10^{-9} m/s²
• After 100 hours: δa = 2.8 × 10^{-12} m/s²

SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO:

    SNR = a_signal / δa = 3.8×10^{-8} / 2.8×10^{-12} ≈ 13,000

This corresponds to a detection significance of ~2,600σ in 100 hours.

5.1.5 Systematic Error Budget
-----------------------------

Error Source              | Contribution (m/s²) | Control Method
--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------
Attractor position (10μm) | 1.4 × 10^{-11}     | Laser interferometer
Mass uncertainty (0.1%)   | 1.0 × 10^{-10}     | Precision weighing
Density inhomogeneity(1%) | 3.8 × 10^{-10}     | Material characterization
Thermal expansion         | 2.1 × 10^{-13}     | Temperature stability <1mK
Magnetic gradients        | 1.0 × 10^{-12}     | μ-metal shielding
Vibration (isolated)      | 1.0 × 10^{-10}     | Active + passive isolation
Lab gravity gradient      | 1.0 × 10^{-11}     | Gradient mapping
--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------
TOTAL SYSTEMATIC          | 1.1 × 10^{-9}      | Quadrature sum

The signal (3.8 × 10^{-8} m/s²) is 36× above total systematics.

5.1.6 Measurement Protocol
--------------------------

PHASE 1 - BASELINE (2 weeks):
□ Static attractor characterization
□ Gravity gradient mapping
□ Interferometer calibration

PHASE 2 - ROTATION TESTS (2 weeks):
□ Classical gravity oscillation measurement
□ Mechanical coupling verification
□ Lock-in phase calibration

PHASE 3 - SCIENCE RUN (4 weeks):
□ 100-hour integration at signal frequency
□ Daily null tests (attractor removed)
□ Multiple rotation directions

PHASE 4 - SYSTEMATICS (4 weeks):
□ Material swap tests (Ti/Cu, Pb/Al)
□ Distance variation (1/r² check)
□ Temperature cycling

5.1.7 Expected Outcomes
-----------------------

DETECTION (SNR > 5):
• Confirms density-dependent gravitational screening
• Measures S(ρ) function directly
• Validates SDCG cosmological predictions

NON-DETECTION (SNR < 3):
• Sets upper limit: μ < 0.05 (95% CL)
• Rules out SDCG as Hubble tension solution
• Constrains alternative modified gravity theories

SECTION 5.2: CASIMIR EXPERIMENT - DEMOTED TO THOUGHT EXPERIMENT (Appendix A)
================================================================================

5.2.1 Concept (Historical Interest Only)
-----------------------------------------

The original proposal involved measuring gravity/Casimir crossover with
different density plates (gold vs silicon) at separation d ≈ 95 μm.

The idea was elegant: at this distance, gravitational and Casimir forces
are comparable, and material-dependent gravity would shift the crossover.

5.2.2 Fundamental Obstacles
---------------------------

PROBLEM 1: THERMAL NOISE
The Casimir force fluctuates due to thermal photons:

    F_thermal ~ k_B T / d ≈ 4 × 10^{-14} N at 300K

The SDCG signal would be:

    ΔF_SDCG ~ G × ρ × V² × μ / d² ≈ 10^{-21} N

Ratio: Signal/Noise ≈ 10^{-7} (signal buried 10 million times below noise!)

Even at 4K: Signal/Noise ≈ 10^{-4} (still unmeasurable)

PROBLEM 2: GAP CONTROL
Maintaining 95 μm ± nm precision during plate swap is practically impossible:
• Thermal expansion: ~1 μm/K (need <1 mK stability)
• Mechanical vibration: ~10 nm even with best isolation
• Surface roughness: comparable to gap precision required

PROBLEM 3: CASIMIR CONTAMINATION
The Casimir force itself depends on material (through dielectric properties):

    F_Casimir(Au) ≠ F_Casimir(Si)

This creates a confounding signal that cannot be separated from SDCG.

5.2.3 Conclusion on Casimir Experiment
--------------------------------------

"The Casimir gravity crossover experiment, while conceptually elegant,
faces insurmountable practical obstacles. Thermal noise alone buries the
SDCG signal by 7 orders of magnitude. We therefore present it as a 
theoretical illustration (Appendix A) rather than a practical test.

The atom interferometry approach (Section 5.1) completely circumvents
these issues by measuring gravitational acceleration directly, without
any contact between test masses and attractor, and at signal-to-noise
ratios exceeding 10,000."

APPENDIX A: CASIMIR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
================================================================================

A.1 Theoretical Setup
---------------------

Consider two parallel plates separated by distance d, one gold (ρ_Au) and
one silicon (ρ_Si). The total force between them is:

    F_total = F_Casimir + F_gravity

In GR:
    F_gravity = G × M_1 × M_2 / d²

In SDCG:
    F_gravity = G × (1 + μ × S(ρ_1)) × (1 + μ × S(ρ_2)) × M_1 × M_2 / d²

At the crossover distance d_c where F_Casimir = F_gravity:

    d_c(GR) ≈ 95 μm (material independent)
    d_c(SDCG) depends on material densities

A.2 Predicted Shift
-------------------

For gold (ρ = 19,300 kg/m³): S_Au ≈ 0.92
For silicon (ρ = 2,330 kg/m³): S_Si ≈ 0.12

The crossover shift would be:

    Δd_c / d_c ≈ (μ/2) × (S_Au - S_Si) ≈ 0.24 × 0.80 ≈ 0.19

This 19% shift (~18 μm) is enormous in principle, but unmeasurable in
practice due to the obstacles described in Section 5.2.2.

A.3 Value as Theoretical Illustration
-------------------------------------

The Casimir thought experiment remains valuable for:

1. PEDAGOGICAL: Illustrates how density-dependent G manifests in lab
2. FALSIFICATION: If someone proposes a Casimir test, we can explain why
   it fails before resources are wasted
3. MOTIVATION: Shows the signal is large enough to detect - just not with
   this particular technique

KEY STATEMENTS FOR PAPER REVISION
================================================================================

ABSTRACT (add):
"We propose a definitive laboratory test using atom interferometry with a
density-modulated rotating attractor, achieving signal-to-noise ratio
exceeding 10,000 within 100 hours of integration."

SECTION 5 OPENING (new):
"Laboratory verification of SDCG requires careful consideration of
achievable sensitivity. While conceptually appealing approaches like
Casimir force crossover measurements face insurmountable thermal noise
(Appendix A), atom interferometry offers a clear path to detection with
current technology."

CONCLUSION (revise):
"The SDCG framework makes falsifiable predictions at multiple scales:
cosmological (H₀, S₈ tensions), astrophysical (dwarf galaxy velocities),
and—critically—laboratory (atom interferometry). The latter offers
detection significance exceeding 2000σ with existing technology,
making SDCG one of the most testable modified gravity proposals."
