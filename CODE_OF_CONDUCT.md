# Code of Conduct for SDCG Project

## 🌌 Introduction

The **Scale-Dependent Coupled Gravity (SDCG)** project is a scientific endeavor to develop, test, and validate a novel modified gravity theory that addresses fundamental cosmological tensions. This project welcomes contributions from physicists, cosmologists, astronomers, data scientists, and anyone interested in fundamental physics.

To maintain a rigorous, respectful, and productive scientific environment, all participants are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces—GitHub discussions, pull requests, issues, documentation, scientific debates, and other forms of communication related to SDCG—both online and offline.

---

## 🔬 Our Scientific Mission

SDCG aims to:

- Develop a theoretically consistent modified gravity framework
- Test predictions against real observational data (SPARC, ALFALFA, Planck, BOSS)
- Address the H₀ and S₈ cosmological tensions
- Propose falsifiable laboratory tests (atom interferometry)
- Maintain complete transparency and reproducibility

---

## 🤝 Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming scientific community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to:

- **Be rigorous** — Base all claims on evidence and sound theoretical reasoning
- **Be respectful** — Treat all participants with dignity regardless of background
- **Be inclusive** — Welcome diverse perspectives, including critical viewpoints
- **Be constructive** — Provide helpful feedback that advances the science
- **Be transparent** — Share methods, data, and code openly
- **Be humble** — Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations honestly

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

### Scientific Misconduct

- Data fabrication, falsification, or manipulation
- Plagiarism or misappropriation of others' work
- Selective reporting of results to misrepresent findings
- Failure to disclose conflicts of interest

### Personal Conduct

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning comments
- Dismissing legitimate scientific criticism without engagement
- Gatekeeping based on credentials, institution, or background
- Publishing private communications without consent

### Community Disruption

- Trolling, bad-faith arguments, or deliberate derailing of discussions
- Dogmatic rejection of evidence-based critique
- Misrepresenting consensus or others' positions
- Spam, self-promotion unrelated to project goals

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

### Scientific Standards

- Use real observational data — no mock data presented as evidence
- Cite sources properly and give credit where due
- Acknowledge when a critique successfully challenges a claim
- Update conclusions when new evidence warrants it
- Distinguish clearly between established results and speculation

### Community Standards

- Use inclusive and welcoming language
- Respect differing scientific viewpoints and methodological preferences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully — it improves the science
- Support newcomers and explain technical concepts patiently
- Focus debates on ideas and evidence, not personalities

### Collaboration Standards

- Document code thoroughly for reproducibility
- Share data and methods openly
- Respond to issues and questions in a timely manner
- Credit all contributors appropriately

## 📊 Data and Reproducibility Standards

SDCG is committed to **open science**:

| Principle           | Implementation                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Data**       | All observational data sources cited with DOIs |
| **Open Code**       | Python/Cobaya code available on GitHub         |
| **Open Methods**    | Complete derivations in thesis/papers          |
| **Reproducibility** | Anyone can run `python main_cgc_analysis.py`   |

### Data Sources Used

- SPARC: Lelli et al. (2016), AJ, 152, 157
- ALFALFA: Haynes et al. (2018), ApJ, 861, 49
- Local Group: McConnachie (2012), AJ, 144, 4
- Planck: Planck Collaboration (2020)
- BOSS/eBOSS: Various public data releases

## 🛠 Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

1. **First offense (minor):** Private discussion and request for correction
2. **Repeated violations:** Formal warning documented in issue tracker
3. **Serious violations:** Temporary suspension from project participation
4. **Scientific misconduct:** Permanent ban and potential reporting to institutions

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct or scientific integrity standards.

---

## 📬 Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

1. Opening an issue tagged `code-of-conduct` (for public resolution)
2. Emailing the maintainer directly (for confidential matters)
3. Using GitHub's built-in reporting tools

**Confidentiality** will be maintained for sensitive reports.

**Response timeline:** We aim to respond within 72 hours.

## ⚖️ Scientific Debate Guidelines

SDCG welcomes rigorous scientific critique. To ensure productive debates:

### DO:

- ✅ Cite specific equations, data, or results you're questioning
- ✅ Propose alternative explanations or tests
- ✅ Acknowledge when a point is well-made
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions before assuming error
- ✅ Suggest improvements, not just criticisms

### DON'T:

- ❌ Dismiss work without engaging with specifics
- ❌ Appeal to authority instead of evidence
- ❌ Move goalposts when predictions are confirmed
- ❌ Conflate speculation with established results
- ❌ Attack the person instead of the argument

## 🔭 Key SDCG Parameters for Reference

For contributors unfamiliar with the theory:

| Parameter | Value       | Meaning                       |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| μ         | 0.47 ± 0.03 | Gravitational coupling (MCMC) |
| μ_bare    | 0.48        | QFT one-loop prediction       |
| β₀        | 0.70        | Conformal anomaly coefficient |
| ρ_thresh  | 200 ρ_crit  | Screening threshold           |
| n_g       | 0.014       | Scale exponent (EFT)          |

**Key results:**

- H₀ tension: 4.8σ → 1.8σ (62% reduction)
- S₈ tension: 2.6σ → 0.8σ (69% reduction)
- Dwarf galaxy signal: 5.3σ after stripping correction
